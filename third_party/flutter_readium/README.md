A Flutter plugin for reading EPUB, audiobook, and WebPub publications, wrapping the [Readium](https://readium.org) toolkits behind a unified Dart API.

flutter_readium is a federated Flutter plugin that delegates to the upstream Readium toolkits on each platform:

- **swift-toolkit 3.9.0** on iOS
- **kotlin-toolkit 3.2.0** on Android
- **ts-toolkit** (`@readium/shared`, `@readium/navigator`) on Web

## Features

- EPUB 2 / EPUB 3 reading, with dynamic horizontal pagination and vertical scrolling modes
- PDF reading on iOS (PDFKit) and Android (PDFium), with layout, reading-progression, page-spacing, and fit preferences
- WebPub reading (including audiobook WebPub)
- Pre-recorded audio playback with track navigation and variable speed
- Synchronized Media Overlays (text-and-audio read-along)
- Platform-native text-to-speech with voice selection, speed, and pitch
- Reader preferences (typography, scroll, columns, ...) via the Readium Preferences API
- Highlights and annotations via the Decorator API
- Position persistence and restoration via Locators
- Content search within open publications
- Real-time event streams for position, playback state, reader status, and errors
- Custom HTTP headers for publication and resource fetching

## Supported formats

¹ Web TTS uses the browser's Web Speech API — voice availability and quality vary by browser.

> **macOS note:** Native macOS desktop (`flutter run -d macos`) is not supported — a no-op stub is registered so the Flutter macOS target still compiles, but every reader call returns `MethodNotImplemented`. The upstream `swift-toolkit` is iOS-only and has marked native macOS [`not_planned`](https://github.com/readium/swift-toolkit/issues/783). The iOS build runs fine on Apple Silicon Macs via "Designed for iPad".

## Minimum requirements

| Requirement | Version                |
| ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Flutter     | 3.32.0+                |
| Dart SDK    | 3.8.0+                 |
| Android     | `minSdkVersion` 24     |
| iOS         | 15.0+                  |

## Getting started

Add the dependency to your app's `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_readium: ^x.y.z
```

Then complete the per-platform setup below. See the [installation guide](https://github.com/notalib/flutter_readium/blob/main/docs/getting-started/installation.md) and the [quick-start walkthrough](https://github.com/notalib/flutter_readium/blob/main/docs/getting-started/quick-start.md) for details.

### Android

- Set `minSdkVersion` to 24 or higher in `android/app/build.gradle`.
- Change your `MainActivity` to extend `FlutterFragmentActivity` (not `FlutterActivity`) — otherwise the reader view will crash at runtime.
- If using TTS or background audio, add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

  ```xml
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
  ```

### iOS

Add the Readium pods to your `ios/Podfile`. The pod URLs must match the version pinned in
`ios/flutter_readium.podspec`. The `example/ios/Podfile` is the source-of-truth for app
integration — copy these lines into your own `Podfile`:

```ruby
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!

  pod 'ReadiumShared', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.9.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumShared.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumInternal', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.9.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumInternal.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumStreamer', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.9.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumStreamer.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumNavigator', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.9.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumNavigator.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumOPDS', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/swift-toolkit/3.9.0/Support/CocoaPods/ReadiumOPDS.podspec'
  pod 'ReadiumZIPFoundation', podspec: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/readium/podspecs/refs/heads/main/ReadiumZIPFoundation/3.0.1/ReadiumZIPFoundation.podspec'
end
```

### Web

1. Copy the plugin's JavaScript bundle into your web app:

   ```bash
   dart run flutter_readium:copy_js_file <destination_directory>
   ```

   The destination should live inside your `web/` directory.

2. Reference the script from `web/index.html`:

   ```html
   <script src="flutter.js" defer></script>
   <script src="readiumReader.js" defer></script>
   ```
